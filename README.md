# Goodrocket Design

Sketch design system and folder structure for your next product design project.

## Sketch design system

- Well organized master sketch file ensuring good project scalability.
- Contains customizable component library based on nested symbol overrides.
- Comes with multiple text styles that can be easily redefined.
- Includes Styleguide page and several layout examples.

---

## Folder structure

For increased productivity, I recommend using this folder structure together with [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and [TemplatesManager workflow](http://www.packal.org/workflow/templatesmanager) or similar automation setup.

- Available design materials (e.g., logos, brand guidelines).
- Snapshot of current design (if there is one) for the record.

### Inspiration

- Video recordings of the prototypes.
